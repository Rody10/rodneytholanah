# CAREER PROFILE

multicultural environments and learning new skills. I am extremely curious and very interested in
knowing how things work. I also like working in a team as I like sharing ideas and collaborating with
other people towards a common goal. I am very organized and self-motivated which means I can work
well as an individual. I am looking for an entry level position where I can be challenged and broaden my
areas of expertise while I build a strong foundation which I can use to grow within my chosen career
path.
